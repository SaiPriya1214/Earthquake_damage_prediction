A case study on how AI can help faster recovery from earthquake damages.The case study is modeled over Gorkha earthquake Nepal.Using the structural,geographical and legal data our task is to predict the severity of damage.
Based on aspects of building location and construction, my goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. All the data have been previously anonymized 

The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.
